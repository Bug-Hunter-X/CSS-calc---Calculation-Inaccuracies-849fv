# CSS calc() Calculation Inaccuracies
This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using the `calc()` function in CSS, specifically when combining percentages and fixed units (like pixels).  The issue arises from the order of operations and how the browser interprets the calculation within different contexts.  The `bug.css` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.css` provides possible solutions.

**Problem:** Inconsistent or unexpected results when subtracting pixels from a percentage width, potentially leading to layout issues or visual discrepancies across different screen sizes and parent container widths. 

**Solutions:** Alternative approaches to achieve the desired layout using different CSS properties or techniques.
