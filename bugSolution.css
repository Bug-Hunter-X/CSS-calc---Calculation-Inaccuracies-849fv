Several solutions exist to address this issue. One is to avoid mixing percentage and pixel values in `calc()` if possible. Instead, use a more predictable approach such as:

**Solution 1: Using viewport units (vw):**  Instead of percentages, use viewport width units (vw) which are relative to the viewport's width.  This ensures the calculation is consistent across different screen sizes.
```css
width: calc(50vw - 10px);
```

**Solution 2: Using Flexbox or Grid:** For more complex layouts, consider using flexbox or grid which provide more robust and predictable control over element sizing and positioning. 

**Solution 3: JavaScript (if absolutely necessary):**  In cases where a purely CSS solution isn't feasible, you can dynamically calculate the width using JavaScript and apply it as an inline style. This requires more overhead but provides absolute control.  However, this is generally less desirable than a pure CSS solution.
